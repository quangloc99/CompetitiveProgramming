# Project Euler solution (original + HackerRank version)
Beside solving the original problem, these solutions here can also get accepted on HackerRank. I did this because the Hacker Rank 
version seems to be more intersting and has more test cases, and also it is closer to Competitive Programming.

For the details how to get the answer of the orignal problem, please see the solution for each problem.
